# NonParamatrics-Project-2
Topic 1
Introduction
With the case of the first topic, we will be exploring four different methods of washing hands and comparing how well they eliminate bacteria. 
This test was conducted by the subject testing four different methods of washing her hands: washing with water only, washing with regular soap, 
washing with antibacterial soap, and spraying hands with antibacterial spray. Each day one of these was chosen at random in the morning. After 
she placed her right hand on a sterile media plate designed to promote bacterial growth. Each plate was incubated for two days at 36 degrees 
celsius. This process took place over a month and the data was collected and given to us.

Topic II

I. Introduction
For this analysis, we are using a dataset called "Mind.csv". This dataset contains two columns. Column 1 is the two categories of treatment 
given to a subject with a particular, unknown to us, mental disorder (Medication, Therapy) and Column 2 is the ordinal scale of improvement 
shown by the patient after a period of 6 months using the treatment (None, Mild, Moderate, Major). We will be studying the relationship between 
the variables by answering the following key questions:
Question #1: What direction of nonparametric tests will we use to analyze this data?
Question #2: Are the two variables independent or dependent?
Question #3: If the variables are dependent, which categories of the two variables are dependent?
